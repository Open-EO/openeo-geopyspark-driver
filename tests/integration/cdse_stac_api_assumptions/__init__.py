Copernicus Dataspace STAC API Assumption Tests

This package contains tests that explicitly verify the assumptions we make about
the Copernicus Dataspace STAC API for various collections.

These tests:
- Query the LIVE STAC API (require network access)
- Document and verify our implementation assumptions
- Help catch breaking changes in the STAC API
- Serve as living documentation of API behavior
