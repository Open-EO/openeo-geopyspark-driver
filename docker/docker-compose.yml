# TODO: Also add zookeeper service when we add service for web app (REST API)

# Here we set `name` because by defaul docker-compose uses the folder name as
# the docker image name. (or does it use the working directory?)
# But we want this example to work well for a new developer, with the least
# amount of set up, and the least amount of surprises.
#
# You can also set the env var COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME.
